## A wasm-compiled demo for [macro_railroad](https://github.com/lukaslueg/macro_railroad)

**See [here](https://lukaslueg.github.io/macro_railroad_wasm_demo/) for a live-demo.**


You'll need nightly (`rustup override set nightly`) and `cargo-web`. Use `cargo web start` to start a local server and start hacking away.

Excuse my non-existent HTML & JS skills. Any pull-request is welcome.
